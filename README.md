For this project I've created a simple pokedex app using mainly async javascript. <br>
My goal was to make it look as similar as possible to the pokedex in Pokemon Go, and to achieve that, I've used some of <br>
Niantic's assets, found via Pokeminers (https://github.com/PokeMiners/pogo_assets) . 
<br>
<br>
This dex will be a work in progress, and is subject to change as I learn more.
